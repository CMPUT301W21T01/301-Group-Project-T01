Experimently is an Android App which features collaborative experimentation amoungst individuals. The app allows the creation of experiment tracking abilities which can be shared / edited / and viewed by users allowing a seamless transistion from recording to viewing. Users can subscribe to experiments to be caught up, search experiments and users to find the exact thing you are looking for. With QR code integration, one can create QR codes which can be scanned within the app and allow users to quickly find/view an experiment or trials of an experiment. Location tracking allows for detailed precision or monitoring and a comment section allows users to interact with one another.
